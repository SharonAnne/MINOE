wildlife species. *Setbacks* Means the horizontal distance between a lot line
or a zoning boundary and buildings, structures, and/or areas. *Solid Manure*
Means agricultural waste that has 20 per cent or more solids and will not flow
when piled. *Tillable Hectares* Land, including pasture, that can be worked or
cultivated. *Undertaking* "Undertaking includes any construction, industry,
operation or other project or any alteration or modification of any existing
undertaking which will or may (a) cause the emission or discharge of any
contaminant into the environment, (b) have an effect on any unique, rare or
endangered feature of the environment, (c) have a significant effect on the
environment or necessitate further development which is likely to have
significant effect on the environment, or (d) cause public concern because of
its real or perceived effect or potential effect on the environment".
*Watercourse * "Watercourse" means any permanent stream, brook, river, lake,
pond, bay, estuary or ocean. The term also refers to any intermittent stream,

php3?number=70588</=E> / 8. APPENDICES
php3?number=70597</=E> / D. Alternate methods of manure treatment and
utilization *Appendix D* Alternate Methods of Manure Treatment and Utilization
*Introduction* The purpose of a treatment system is to convert the manure to a
more stable product. The treatment process may be designed to solve odour
problems, recover nutrients or energy from the manure, increase the fertilizer
value, reduce the volume, or decrease the pollution potential of the manure. In
environmentally sensitive areas, such as Holland, manure management practices
are strictly regulated and enforced to minimize odour and pollution problems.
In these circumstances, treatment systems can be justified economically. In
countries where fuel is very expensive or not readily available, the energy
recovered from methane gas production is worth the labour investment. For the
majority of livestock producers in Prince Edward Island, most odour problems
can be solved by a combination of good management and the separation of
livestock farms from residential areas. Manure can be easily disposed on the
available crop land. As long as energy and feed prices are relatively low, the
most cost-effective treatment system is storage of the manure, followed by
spreading the manure on cropland. In the future, however, there may be
circumstances where another method of treatment is desirable. This section will
present some of the treatment systems that have been studied and provide a
brief outline of the feasibility and possible benefits of each system.
Biological Treatment */Aerobic Processes/*/:/ The aerobic processes that may
have some application in Prince Edward Island are; storage aeration, pre-
storage aeration, and composting. */Storage Aeration/*/:/ Storage aeration is
used to maintain the manure in an aerobic state. When manure has sufficient
amounts of oxygen present, very little odour is produced, and a significant
amount of nitrogen can be removed from the manure by microorganisms. Where the
land base available for spreading is limited, it may be necessary to try to
reduce the nitrogen content of the manure before it is spread on the land.
However, in Prince Edward Island, the manure has value as a source of nutrients
for plants, and the land base is large enough to spread all the manure produced
without risk of pollution. During the summer, liquid manure can be treated
aerobically by using mechanical aeration equipment. Mechanical aerators operate
by either pumping air bubbles into the manure, or by spraying the manure into
the air. A high energy input is required to supply enough oxygen to the manure
and keep the manure well mixed, and as with all mechanical equipment, a certain
amount of maintenance is required to keep the system functional. The energy
costs and labour requirements needed to keep a large volume of manure aerobic
are high. Generally, total aeration is only used when the manure is to be
spread in an area where odour control is important and soil incorporation is
not possible. It is not practical to aerate manure that has been collected and
stored under anaerobic conditions during the winter. Aeration is only feasible
when the storage is emptied in the spring and fall, and aeration is used as a
method of odour control during the summer. In Prince Edward Island, storage
aeration systems are only used in the treatment of municipal liquid waste. The
cost of aerating the manure and maintaining the equipment are high. It is
usually less expensive to control odours by building the livestock operation
with adequate separation distance and/or by using a covered storage of limited
size. */Pre-Storage Aeration/*/:/ An alternative method of controlling odours
from stored liquid manure is pre-storage aeration. A treatment tank is used to
hold seven days of manure production. The manure is partially decomposed under
warm, aerobic conditions, and then transferred to the long term storage.
Although the manure is held anaerobically in the long term storage, the odour
level is reduced because the manure is partially decomposed. The success of
this system under Prince Edward Island conditions is unproven. */Composting/*/:
/ Composting is an alternate method of manure treatment and utilization. Refer
to Section 4.13
php3?number=70799#4.13> for a description of the composting process. The
following chart shows the benefits and drawbacks of on-farm composting.
*BENEFITS AND DRAWBACKS OF ON-FARM COMPOSTING* *Benefits of composting*
*Drawbacks of composting* Excellent soil conditioner Time and money involved
Saleable product Land required for operations Improves manure handling
Possibility of odours Improves land application Weather interferes with
composting Lowers risk of pollution and nuisance complaints Diversion of manure
and crop residues from crop land Pathogen destruction Potential loss of
nitrogen in manure Bedding substitute Slow release of nutrients in compost May
reduce soil borne plant diseases Possible revenue from processing */Anaerobic
Processes/*/: /With controlled anaerobic treatment processes, such as anaerobic
lagoons and anaerobic digesters, the temperature and the nutrient levels of the
manure are regulated so that only desirable gases and end products are
produced. Whenever manure is stored in a pit or a pile, the manure decomposes
anaerobically, but because the process is not controlled, many different gases
can be formed. The type of gases and end products formed by the anaerobic
decomposition will depend upon the temperature and characteristics of the
manure. */Anaerobic Lagoons/*/:/ Anaerobic lagoons are often confused with
earthen manure storages. Lagoons are carefully designed and managed to maintain
optimum loading rates, retention time and temperature of the manure to maintain
a balance between the acid-forming and methane-forming bacteria. Earthen
storages are simply basins designed to store the manure between periods of land
application. Lagoons have been used successfully in warmer climates, but in
Prince Edward Island where low temperatures occur for much of the year, the
methane-forming bacteria become inactive, and the rate of decomposition is
slow, with the result that lagoons fill rapidly with solids that do not become
stabilized. During the spring when the manure temperature begins to increase,
the acid-forming, rather than the methane-forming bacteria become active and
begin to decompose the manure accumulated over the winter. When this occurs,
the system is unbalanced and offensive odours are produced. */Anaerobic
Digesters/*/:/ Anaerobic digesters are used to produce and recover methane gas
from the decomposition of manure. Digesters consist of a large, airtight tank
with devices for controlling the input of fresh manure into the tank, mixing
the manure, maintaining the correct temperature, and drawing off methane gas
and components of the digested manure. Methane production is affected by the
temperature, loading rate, mixing, digestion time, and characteristics of the
manure. To optimize the amount of methane produced by a digester, all the
factors mentioned above must be carefully controlled. The control of these
factors can be accomplished by a lot of labour or by mechanization.
Unfortunately, both approaches are costly when compared with the value of the
methane gas recovered. The methane produced by anaerobic digestion has a low
energy level per unit volume, making storage expensive, so its use is limited
to stationary applications such as space heating. Although in the past there
has been considerable interest in methane gas production, the system is not
economically viable for Prince Edward Island. The high capital costs for
equipment combined with the high management requirements make this system
impractical. At present, other energy forms such as electricity are less
expensive and much more versatile. Physical Treatment */Refeeding/*/:/ There
have been attempts made to recover some of the nutrients and energy contained
in hog manure by feeding them back to livestock. Some form of treatment is
required to improve animal acceptability, destroy pathogens and reduce odours.
These forms of treatment include dehydration, treatment with formaldehyde and
formalin, fermentation and aerobic treatment. While there have been situations
on experimental farms where liquid wastes have been reefed to swine, there is
considerable debate regarding the value of this practice on commercial hog
farms. Generally, refeeding is most successful when the manure from monogastric
species such as swine, is reefed to a ruminant species such as cattle. The
handling of recycled manure presents problems, since most feeding systems are
designed for dry rations. The risk of disease transmission makes the
possibility of future acceptance unlikely until an improved process is
developed. */Dehydration/*/: /Dehydration is a process that can be used for
odour control. Dry manure does not support the growth of either microorganisms
or insects such as flies. As well, dry manure can be used as a soil
conditioner, in much the same way as composted manure. The problem with
dehydration is that the costs associated with moisture removal are high and can
not be fully recovered from the sale of the final product. */Solids Separation/
*/:/ There are several benefits for separating the solid and the liquid
portions of hog manure. In some manure handling systems, it is sometimes
desirable to recycle the liquids for flushing. Another reason for separation of
the solids from the liquid manure is to allow the use of different treatment
processes. Removing the solids can serve a similar function to pre-storage
aeration. The remaining liquid is less concentrated and therefore will produce
less odour when it decomposes. Depending upon the degree of separation, the
solids may be dry enough to be composted, and the remaining liquid will be
easier to handle when spreading on the land or aerating. The disadvantage of
solids separation is the need for two separate manure handling systems.
Separation can be done using filters or screens, or by allowing the solids to
settle in a large tank or basin while removing the liquids from the top.
Mechanical equipment is available, including centrifuges, cyclone separators,
stationary and vibrating screens, in a variety of sizes. Depending upon the
flow rate and the type of mechanical equipment used, up to 50 percent of the
solids can be removed. Settling basins can remove up to 95 percent of the
solids, depending upon the design. A method of separation that has been used in
other areas of Canada is to transfer the fresh liquid manure to a covered
concrete tank where the solids are separated by settling. Conventional manure
pumps are then used to agitate and remove the solids. The liquids are
transferred from the concrete tank to an uncovered earthen manure storage. This
system has the benefit of using low cost, open storage for the large volume of
liquids having a low nuisance potential, and a higher cost, covered storage for
the smaller volume of highly concentrated manure which can produce the most
offensive odours. However, the effectiveness of this method of separation for
odour control has not been quantified. Last Updated : 2005-10-03 Site Map

php3?number=70597</=E> / E. Existing Legislation *Appendix E* Existing
Legislation Livestock producers and the public should understand how the
provincial, federal and municipal regulations affect livestock operations.
Existing livestock operations are expected to follow practices that are
environmentally friendly. In an existing operation where an environmental
problem has been identified, an upgrading of existing facilities and/or
management practices may be required. The following steps should be followed
when preparing a development proposal for an expanding or new livestock
operation: * become familiar with the planning process and requirements of the
province and or municipality, * determine whether local planning regulations
will permit future growth, * have a manure management plan to demonstrate that
the operation will not be a source of trouble in the future. * inform local
area residents about the project, respond to concerns and ensure no
misconceptions exist since producers who develop good relations with the public
are more likely to have their proposals accepted. Environmental Protection Act
The Environmental Protection Act allows the province to take such actions as it
considers necessary in order to manage, protect, and enhance the environment.
Section 20 states: /"Except as permitted by the regulations or by the Minister
in writing, no person shall:/ // * ///discharge, or cause, or permit to be
discharged,/ // * ///being the owner or person having control of a contaminant,
discharge or cause or permit to be discharged, a contaminant into the
environment"/ Section 21 states: /"Every person that, without permission of the
Minister, discharges a contaminant into the environment shall:/ // * ///
immediately notify the Department; and/ // * ///take such action as the
Minister may direct/ /- to investigate and define the extent, nature and impact
of the contaminant,/ /- to repair, restore and remedy the environment or to
confine and contain the effects of the contaminant"./ The definition of a /
"contaminant" /includes any solid, liquid, gas, waste, odour or combination of
them; * /which is foreign to, orin excess of the natural constituents of the
environment into which it is being introduced,/ * /which will or may adversely
affect, either directly or indirectly, the natural, physical, chemical, or
biological quality of the environment,/ // * ///which is injurious to the
health and safety of a person or be damaging to a property, or to plant and
animal life,/ * /which interferes, or is likely to interfere, with the comfort,
well being, livelihood or enjoyment of life of a person./ Pollution of surface
water or groundwater by manure nutrients, bacteria, etc., or the pollution of
the atmosphere by excessive odours from a livestock operation or by manure
spreading may be included under Sections 20 and 21 of the Environmental
Protection Act. Section 7 and 7.1 gives the Minister of Technology and
Environment the authority to issue an order to stop a person or corporation
from discharging a contaminant into the environment. The same section also
describes the powers of enforcement officers. Section 9 states that no person
shall initiate any undertaking unless that person files a written proposal with
the Department and obtains from the Minister written approval to proceed with
the proposed undertaking. This section may require the proponent of new or
expanding commercial livestock facilities to first provide an Environmental
Impact Statement and notify the public of the proposal and provide opportunity
for comment (See Section 9) P.E.I. Roads Act Section 37 (3) of the P.E.I. Roads
Act/"prohibits any dirt, filth or rubbish of any nature whatsoever, or any
material, object or thing which is offensive to the general appearance being
put or placed on any portion of the right-of-way of any road or street"./ When
using a public roadway to transport manure to the fields, it is important for
the operator to use proper equipment to avoid spills and leaks occurring on the
roadway. If manure or dirt is deposited on the roadway, the owner/operator
should remove it as soon as possible. Springtime weight restrictions apply to
the transportation of manure on highways. P.E.I. Planning Act The Planning Act
Regulation (12) states that "/no person shall without first obtaining a
building permit issued by the Minister;/ // * ///Commence the construction of
any building or structure,/ * /change the location of any building or
structure,/ * /make any major structural alterations or to change the interior
or exterior dimensions of any building or structure"./ The Planning Act
Regulations may specify conditions to the building permit as well as require
certain specified separation distances between buildings and right-of-ways,
property lines, etc. Federal Fisheries Act The Federal Fisheries Act states /
"it is illegal to harmfully alter, disrupt, or destroy fish habitat. It is also
unlawful to deposit or to permit the deposit of, a substance in waters
frequented by fish, which is deleterious to fish, fish habitat or the use of
fish by persons"./ Municipal By-Laws Municipalities that have adopted Official
Plans have the authority to regulate land use within their jurisdiction.
Usually there is some form of zoning for various uses. Conditions may exist for
buffer strips, covered manure storages, direct injection of manure and any
other requirement that the community council considers necessary to prevent
conflicts from occurring. Last Updated : 2005-10-03 Site Map
