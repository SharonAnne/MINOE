Water Classification Order
3The Minister may, in the Minister‚Äôs discretion, with the approval of the
Lieutenant-Governor in Council and in accordance with this Regulation, by a
Water Classification Order classify all or any portion of the water of a
watercourse as one of the classes set out in paragraph¬ 4(a), (c), (d), (e) or
(f).

Classes of water
4(1)The classes of water for the purposes of classification under this
Regulation are as follows:
(a)Outstanding Natural Waters class, applying to representative examples of
naturally occurring water of a watercourse or uniquely outstanding natural
water of a watercourse that, in the opinion of the Minister, meets the criteria
set out in section¬ 5;
(b)AP class, applying to all the water that is classified as AP class under
section¬ 6;
(c)AL class, applying to the water of lakes, ponds and impoundments that is
classified as AL class under section¬ 7 and, where the water is being
classified or reclassified by a Water Classification Order, to the water of
lakes, ponds and impoundments that is intended by the Minister to meet the
applicable standards;
(d)A class, applying to the water of watercourses, if the water
(i)in the opinion of the Minister, can or could support use as a habitat for
aquatic life, use for primary and secondary contact activity and other
appropriate uses that will not prevent the applicable standards from being met,
and
(ii)is intended by the Minister to meet the applicable standards;
(e)B class, applying to the water of watercourses, if the water
(i)in the opinion of the Minister, can or could support use as a habitat for
aquatic life, use for primary and secondary contact activity and other
appropriate uses that will not prevent the applicable standards from being met,
and
(ii)is intended by the Minister to meet the applicable standards; and
(f)C class, applying to the water of watercourses, if the water
(i)in the opinion of the Minister, can or could support use as a habitat for
aquatic life, use for secondary contact activity and other appropriate uses
that will not prevent the applicable standards from being met, and
(ii)is intended by the Minister to meet the applicable standards.
4(2)Notwithstanding anything else in this Regulation, no water shall be
classified as more than one class at any one time.

Criteria for classification as Outstanding Natural Waters class
5A watercourse and the water of the watercourse shall meet the following
criteria in order for the water to be classified as Outstanding Natural Waters
class:
(a)the quality and quantity of the water are as naturally occurring, allowing
for changes in the chemistry or flow of the water that, in the opinion of the
Minister, are barely measurable changes resulting from atmospheric conditions
or uses of the water or associated land;
(b)the aquatic community of the water and of the watercourse is as naturally
occurring, allowing for changes in the chemistry or flow of the water with
resulting changes in its aquatic community that, in the opinion of the
Minister, are barely measurable changes resulting from atmospheric conditions
or uses of the water or associated land, and allowing for the presence of non-
indigenous species if they are ecologically stable;
(c)no contaminants are being released into the watercourse or the water, other
than those causing barely measurable changes resulting from atmospheric
conditions or uses of the water or associated land;
(d)the water of the watercourse meets standards at least as stringent as the
applicable standards;
(e)the water is suitable as a habitat for aquatic life and for other
appropriate uses that will not prevent the applicable standards from being met;
and
(f)the watercourse, in the opinion of the Minister, has one or more of the
following characteristics:
(i)the quality of the water in the watercourse or the nature of its aquatic
community is of a type commonly found in the Province;
(ii)a chemical or physical quality or characteristic of the water in the
watercourse is unique;
(iii)it contains a rare, unique, threatened or endangered aquatic community;
(iv)it possesses outstanding recreational, aesthetic or historical qualities;
or
(v)the quality of the water in the watercourse is such that protecting it in
its natural state is of paramount importance to the people of the Province and
would, in the opinion of the Minister, support or promote clean water or the
integrity of the ecosystem.

Classification of Protected Areas
6On the commencement of this Regulation, the following water shall be
classified as AP class:
(a)all the water in a Protected Area A, whether that Protected Area A is
designated as a protected area under the Watershed Protected Area Designation
Order before, on or after the commencement of this section, during such time as
it remains so designated; and
(b)all the water of all watercourses flowing into a Protected Area A, during
such time as paragraph¬ (a) applies to the water in that protected area.

Classification of lakes, ponds and impoundments
7(1)Subject to subsections (1) and (2), on the commencement of this Regulation,
the water of all lakes, ponds and impoundments shall be classified as AL class,
if the water is not already classified as AP class.
7(2)Subsection¬ (1) does not apply to excavations or containment structures
used for the purpose of ponds on golf courses or for the purpose of wastewater
treatment, ponds constructed for fish culture, agricultural purposes or fire
protection or other artificially created ponds.
7(3)The Minister, with the approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council and
in accordance with this Regulation, may in the Minister‚Äôs discretion in or by
a Water Classification Order exclude from the AL class

applies and that are located partly or wholly within a wetland that is being
used or is to be used for peat extraction, and
(b)the water of any impoundments to which subsection¬ (1) applies,
and paragraphs 10(1)(a) and (c) apply with the necessary modifications to such
an order.
7(4)The water of any lake, pond or impoundment to which an order made under
subsection¬ (3) applies may, in the Minister‚Äôs discretion, with the approval
of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council and in accordance with this Regulation,
subsequently be designated as AL or any other class of water in or by a Water
Classification Order and sections 3 to 5 and 8 to 10 apply with the necessary
modifications to such an order.

a class under this Regulation and it is meeting any applicable standard for
that class of water, no person shall affect or use the water, the watercourse
or any area located within the boundaries of the watershed of the watercourse,
whether above, on or below the earth‚Äôs surface, or cause it to be affected or
used, so as directly or indirectly to cause the water to cease to meet the
standard.
18(2)Subject to section¬ 16, where the water of a watercourse is classified as
a class under this Regulation but it is not meeting any applicable standard for
that class of water, no person shall affect or use the water, the watercourse
or any area located within the boundaries of the watershed of the watercourse,
whether above, on or below the earth‚Äôs surface, or cause it to be affected or
used, so as to impede or stop, directly or indirectly, any progress that the
quality of the water may have been making or might have made toward meeting any
of the applicable standards for that class of water.
18(3)Subject to section¬ 16, where the water of a watercourse is classified as
a class under this Regulation but it is not meeting any applicable standard for
that class of water, no person shall affect or use the water, the watercourse
or any area located within the boundaries of the watershed of the watercourse,
whether above, on or below the earth‚Äôs surface, or cause it to be affected or
used, so as directly or indirectly to cause the water to degrade in relation to
the standard.
18(4)If the water of a watercourse is classified as a class under this
Regulation, no person shall carry out an activity that is prohibited in
relation to that class under column 6 of Schedule A, in, on or under the water,
the watercourse or any area located within the boundaries of the watershed of
the watercourse, whether above, on or below the earth‚Äôs surface.
18(5)No person shall create a new mixing zone, or release a contaminant into a
mixing zone, in water that is classified as a class under this Regulation, if
(a)the person, the release or the mixing zone violates or fails to conform with
any prohibition that is set out in column 6 of Schedule A in relation to that
class, or
(b)the mixing zone at any time does not meet the standards set out in Schedule
B.

SCHEDULE B
Minimum Mixing Zone Standards
1A mixing zone shall not be of a size, shape or character that impairs or
interferes with existing and appropriate uses of the receiving water outside
the mixing zone.
2A mixing zone of a release in the water of a lake, pond or impoundment in
existence on the commencement of the Regulation to which this Schedule is
attached shall not exceed 10 per cent of the volume of the portion of the
receiving water available for mixing.
3A mixing zone in a watercourse shall allow an appropriate zone of passage for
movement and drift of all stages of aquatic life in the water of the
watercourse and, for materials that elicit an avoidance response from aquatic
life, the mixing zone shall not occupy more than 25 per cent of the cross-
sectional area or volume of flow at any transect in the receiving water of the
watercourse.
4A mixing zone in a watercourse shall not cause the accumulation of
contaminants in the sediments or biota of the watercourse to a degree that
impairs existing or appropriate uses.
5A mixing zone in a watercourse shall not interfere with, or cause an
irreversible change in the physical or chemical nature of, spawning grounds,
nursery areas or migration routes of any aquatic species in the water of the
watercourse.
6A mixing zone shall not contain any contaminant so concentrated that, in an
acute lethality test established by the Minister, it is shown to kill more than
50 per cent of any test organisms subjected to it during an exposure period
specific to those test organisms.
7A mixing zone shall not cause a measurable change in the biological
characteristics of the community structure of an organism that is an endangered
species, as defined under the Endangered Species Act, cause such an organism to
respond in an irreversible or harmful manner, render such an organism more
vulnerable to predation or cause an irreversible change in the physical or
chemical nature of the habitat of such an organism.
8A mixing zone shall not contain any contaminant in a concentration that would
attract fish, invertebrates or wildlife.
9A mixing zone in a watercourse shall not overlap with another mixing zone
existing in the watercourse and, if 2 or more mixing zones are in proximity in
the watercourse, the minimum mixing zone standards set out in this Schedule
shall be applied to the 2 mixing zones as though they were combined into one
zone.
10Subject to sections 1 to 9 of this Schedule, a mixing zone shall meet the
limits for linear distances from the point of release, surface area
involvement, volume of the receiving water entrained in the plume and other
definable, quantifiable limits established by the Minister that are set out in
