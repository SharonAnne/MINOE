                   Beneficial Management Practices (BMP)

               COVERED FEEDLOTS - FARMYARD RUNOFF CONTROL
                             BMP # 0502, 0503
Uncontrolled runoff passing through feedlots may become contaminated with manure. This
runoff may transport nutrients and harmful bacteria to surface and groundwater resources
presenting a risk to both human and animal health. Covered feedlots replace outside cattle
feedlots and provide total confinement for the livestock while not on pasture.

Eligibility Criteria:
   •   An Environmental Farm Plan (EFP) must have been completed/updated WITHIN THE
       PAST FIVE YEARS.
   •   The project you wish to complete must be identified in your EFP Action Plan.
   •   The Project Advisor must approve the plan or design that will be used for the covered
       feedlot.
   •   Funds will be allocated on receipt of completed applications. No expenditure will be
       funded which is incurred prior to written approval.
   •   The Project Advisor must complete a site visit prior to project initiation to review options
       and discuss project detail with applicant. Contact George Piercey, PEI Department of
       Agriculture, (902)620-3044 gapiercey@gov.pe.ca for additional information.

Eligible Expenses:
• engineering fees (optional)
• site preparation costs
• material and labour costs for that portion of the concrete floor that is required to house
the livestock (excludes the area under feed bunks or alleys)
• material and labour costs for that portion of the roof that is directly above the area that
is required to house the livestock (excludes the area over feed bunks or alleys)

Funding Assistance:
Funding assistance will be provided at a rate of 50% of eligible expenses to a maximum of
$20,000 within the Farmyard Runoff Control category.

Responsibilities of Applicant:
   •   The applicant must adhere to the Construction Guidelines for farmyard runoff control
       (covered feedlots) to mitigate potential environmental risks during construction. These
       will be provided with project approval.
   •   The applicant must comply with the Guidelines for Manure Management for Prince
       Edward Island with respect to storage, handling, stockpiling manure in a field and
       spreading of manure.
   •   The applicant is responsible for obtaining required licenses, permits, approvals or
       authorizations and for complying with all applicable municipal, provincial and federal
       legislation.
   •   The applicant must provide separate invoices for site preparation, installed floor and roof
       construction when submitting a claim.
   •   The applicant must ensure that all works constructed through this program will be
       maintained and properly managed for a minimum 15 year period.
    •   The applicant must ensure that all livestock are confined in the facility during the
        duration of the year that they are in a feedlot environment. Failure to do so will result in a
        requirement to fully repay the financial assistance that was received.
    •   The applicant must ensure that manure which is removed from the facility is not
        stockpiled adjacent to the covered feedlot within the farmstead. It must be properly
        stockpiled in a field as prescribed in the Guidelines for Manure Management for PEI.
        Failure to do so will result in a requirement to fully repay the financial assistance that
        was received.
    •   Stockpiles are to be located at upper slope locations where they cannot be subjected to
        upslope runoff and they cannot be placed in a location that is subject to ponding.
            o Stockpiles are to be located a minimum of 300 meters (1000 feet) from a public
                water source.
            o Stockpiles are to be located a minimum of 90 meters (300 feet) from all
                watercourses, lakes, ponds, natural wetlands, residences and residential wells.
            o Stockpiles are to be located in an area that will not result in runoff to highway
                ditches.

Covered Feedlot Requirements:
    •   Funding will only be approved for a covered feedlot if it completely addresses an existing
        problem.
    •   It is recommended that the covered feedlot be designed by a qualified Professional
        Engineer who is licensed to practice on PEI.
    •   A building permit number must be submitted with the project application.
    •   The covered feedlot must be capable of storing the manure within the facility for a
        minimum 2 month period for that portion of the winter when access to fields may be
        impossible due to excessive snow and/or wet field conditions.
    •   All upslope runoff must be diverted away from the covered feedlot.
    •   The concrete floor must be 12.5 centimeters. (5 inches) thick, using 25 MPa (4000 PSI)
        concrete with 10 M rebar both ways at 60 centimeters. (2 foot) centres.
    •   The roof and its support system must be designed to adequately support local snow and
        wind loads.
    •   Prices will be obtained from contractors annually by the PEIDA to determine the costs on
        a per unit area basis for constructed roofs and floors. These costs will establish
        maximums that the program will cost share.
