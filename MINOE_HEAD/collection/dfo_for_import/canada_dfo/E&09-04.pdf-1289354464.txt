     Water Treatment Definitions

     Aeration
     The process of adding air to water. Air is added to water by passing air
     through water or passing water through air.

     Diatomaceous earth filters
     A filter technology using a thin layer of diatomaceous earth (a fine,
     siliceous material) that is deposited on a porous plate to serve as a filter.
     A good technology for smaller systems because of its relative simplicity
     of units and maintenance requirements.

     Direct filtration
     A filtration process where the sedimentation stage of conventional
     filtration is omitted. Filtration is performed directly after the flocculation
     stage of treatment. A filter aid is usually added before filtration.

     Dissolved air flotation
     The process of solids removal whereby dissolved air is added to the
     clarifier from the bottom of the basin and the air raises suspended
     particles to the top of the water where the particles are removed by
     skimming.

     Electrodialysis
     The process where brackish water flows between alternating cation-
     permeable and anion-permeable membranes. A direct electronic current
     provides the motive force to cause ions to migrate through the
     membranes and either react to create a gas or remain in a separate
     solution as brine wastewater.

     Horizontal-flow
     A flow of water in a horizontal direction through a rectangular or round
     sedimentation and clarification basin, as opposed to the vertical or
     upward flow that is found in a solids-contact clarifier.

     Injection mixers
     The use of perforated tubes or nozzles to disperse the coagulant into the
     water being treated. Provides uniform distribution of the coagulant over
     the entire basin. Generally sensitive to flow changes and may require
     frequent adjustments to produce the proper amount of mixing.

     In-line blender mixers
     Used for coagulant mixing where coagulant is added through a diffuser
     in a pipe directly to water being treated. Provides rapid dispersion of the
Updated 2006                  Environmental Protection Act                    Cap. E-9   19
               Drinking Water and Wastewater Facility Operating Regulations


coagulant without significant heat loss. Energy consumption is less than
a comparable mechanical mixer.

Mechanical dewatering
The use of mechanical devices such as centrifuges and rotational
mechanisms to force the separation of solids (sludge) from liquids
(water).

Mechanical mixers
These are paddles, turbines, and propellers frequently used in
coagulation facilities. Mechanical mixers use electrical energy for mixing
the coagulant with the water being treated.

pH adjustment
The alteration of the pH of the raw water or pretreated water by
mechanical or chemical procedures to enhance the performance of the
treatment process.

Reverse osmosis
The passage of water from a concentrated solution through a
semipermeable membrane to fresh water with the application of pressure.

SCADA instrumentation
The Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition system is a computer-
based system that monitors and controls remote water facility sites. A
SCADA master control is typically located in a dedicated control centre
or treatment facility control room. Remote sites are equipped with remote
terminal units to gather information and issue instructions from the
master station.

Solids composting
The mixing of sludge with decaying organic material for eventual use as
fertilizer.

Stability or corrosion control
The removal of dissolved gases, treatment of the finished water to make
it noncorrosive, and the building of protective coating inside the pipe.

Tube sedimentation
Tube settlers or high rate settlers are placed in rectangular or circular
basins. Water enters the inclined settler tubes and is directed upward
through the tubes. Each tube functions as a shallow settling basin.
Particles collect on the inside surfaces of the tubes or settle to the bottom
of the basin.

                Drinking Water and Wastewater Facility Operating Regulations



     Up-flow solid-contact sedimentation
     A unit that combines the coagulation, flocculation, and sedimentation
     processes into a single basin, which is either rectangular or circular in
     shape. Flow is an upward direction through a sludge blanket or slurry of
     flocculated, suspended solids.

     Urban runoff
     During dry periods, oil, grease, gasoline, and other residues accumulate
     on paved surfaces. During a storm, this material is washed into local
     receiving water from roadway storm drainage systems. Urban runoff also
     contains animal droppings from pets and fertilizers used for landscaping,
     the residues of which contribute to taste and odor complaints in drinking
     water.

     Wastewater Treatment Definitions

     The following definitions are provided for the interpretation of Table 3
     of Schedule A.

     Activated sludge
     The wastewater treatment by aeration of suspended organisms followed
     by clarification, including extended aeration, Intermittent Cycle
     Extended Aeration System (ICEAS), and other similar processes. A
     sequencing batch reactor with the purpose of providing this form of
     treatment is rated under this category.

     Biological or chemical and biological advanced waste treatment
     The advanced treatment of wastewater for nutrient removal, including
     nitrification, denitrification, or phosphorous removal using biological or
     chemical processes or a combination. If the facility is designed to nitrify
     based solely on detention time in an extended aeration system, only the
     points for nitrification by designed extended aeration shall be given.

     Chemical addition/Pretreatment
     The addition of a chemical to wastewater at an application point for the
     purposes of adjusting pH or alkalinity, improving solids removal,
     dechlorinating, removing odors, providing nutrients, or otherwise
     enhancing treatment, excluding chlorination for the disinfection of
     effluent and the addition of enzymes or any process included in the
     tertiary treatment chemical and physical processes. The capability to add
     a chemical at different application points for the same purpose is rated as
     one application; the capability to add a chemical or chemicals to dual
     units is also rated as one application. The capability to add a chemical at
     different application points for different purposes is rated as a separate
     application.

     Chemical or physical advanced treatment following secondary
     treatment
     The use of chemical or physical advanced treatment processes following,
     or in conjunction with, a secondary treatment process. This includes
     processes such as carbon adsorption, air stripping, chemical coagulation,
     and precipitation.

     Chemical or physical advanced treatment without secondary
     treatment
     The use of chemical or physical advanced treatment processes without
     the use of a secondary treatment process. This includes processes such as
     carbon adsorption, air stripping, chemical coagulation, and precipitation.

               Drinking Water and Wastewater Facility Operating Regulations



Fixed-film reactor
Biofiltration by trickling filters or rotating biological contactors followed
by secondary clarification.

Imhoff tanks (or similar)
Includes Imhoff tanks, septic tanks, spirogester, clarigester, or other
single units for combined sedimentation and digestion.

Land application of biosolids by contractor
The land application or beneficial reuse of biosolids by a contractor
outside of the control of the operator in direct responsible charge of the
wastewater treatment facility.

Land treatment and disposal (surface or subsurface)
The ultimate treatment and disposal of the effluent onto the surface of the
ground by rapid infiltration or rotary distributor or by spray irrigation.
Subsurface treatment and disposal is accomplished by infiltration gallery,
injection, or gravity or pressurized drain field.

Mechanical dewatering of solids
The removal of water from sludge by any of the following processes,
including the addition of polymers in any of the following: vacuum
filtration; frame; belt or plate filter presses; centrifuge; or dissolved air
flotation.

Mechanical post-aeration
The introduction of air into the effluent by mechanical means such as
diffused or mechanical aeration. Cascade aeration would not be assigned
points.

Media filtration
The advanced treatment of wastewater for removal of solids by sand or
other media or mixed media filtration.

Solids composting
The biological decomposition process producing carbon dioxide, water,
and heat. Typical methods are windrow, forced air-static pile, and in-
vessel.

Solids stabilization
The processes to oxidize or reduce the organic matter in sludge to a more
stable form. These processes reduce pathogens or reduce the volatile
organic chemicals and thereby reduce the potential for odor. These
