                             ON-FARM FUEL STORAGE
                                   BMP # 0801
Proper storage and handling of petroleum products used in the fuelling of farm vehicles
and equipment may prevent the contamination of soils, surface and/or ground waters.

Eligibility Criteria:

Funding Assistance:
Assistance for expenditures will be provided at a rate of 30%of eligible costs to a
maximum of $15,000 within the Product and Waste Management category.

Responsibilities of Applicant:
   •   The applicant must adhere to the Construction Guidelines for Improved On-Farm
       Storage and Handling of Fertilizers, Pesticides and Petroleum Products to
       mitigate potential environmental risks during construction. These will be provided

Fuel Storage Requirements:
The above ground storage of petroleum products on farms is regulated in the province
by the Fire Marshall’s office. NFPA 395 is the applicable fire code for fuel storage
systems used on farms.

TANKS:
    •   The tank(s) must be ULC certified.
    •   Tank(s) must be a minimum of 15.24 meters (50 feet) from nearest building.
    •   Tank(s) must have at least a 15.24 centimeter (6 inch) clearance from ground
        level.
    •   Tanks must be at least 30 meters (98.5 feet) from a water body.
    •   Tanks must be at least 15 meters (49 feet) from the nearest well.
    •   There must be no risk of a contaminating substance being released into a water
        body.
    •   Tanks must have a sign identifying the product that is being stored.
    •   Tanks must have a corrosion protection coating and/or be primed and painted to
    •   prevent rusting.

FILL / VENT PIPE:
• All outside above ground tank(s) must have an emergency relief vent.
• All pipes must be either wrought iron or steel pipe material.
• The vent pipe must be provided with a weatherproof vent cap.
• The vent must be a minimum of 3.175 centimeters (1.25 inches) in diameter.
• Vent outlets for gasoline storage tanks must be at least 2.13 meters (7 feet) above
ground level.
• Vent outlets for diesel storage tanks must be higher than the fill pipe and above normal
snow level.

ELECTRICAL:
    •   Electrical work associated with the dispensing equipment must be performed by
        a licensed electrical contractor. The electrical contractor must submit a copy of
        the Certificate of Compliance to the farmer.

NOTE:
Buildings and roofs over fuel storage facilities are not an eligible expense. However, if a building
or roof is to be constructed, a building permit is required. The building must also be adequately
ventilated according to NFPA 30 which states that the building must have at least one totally open
wall or a minimum continuous 30.48 centimeter (12 inch) open space around the top and bottom
of each wall (this open space can be covered with mesh). Ridge vents and gable end vents are
also encouraged.
