                          EROSION CONTROL STRUCTURES
                                   BMP # 1201
Installation of erosion control structures may reduce topsoil loss due to erosion and prevent the contamination of
surface and/or ground waters from potentially hazardous materials bound to the eroded soil particles.

Eligibility Criteria:
    •    An Environmental Farm Plan (EFP) must have been completed/updated WITHIN THE PAST FIVE
         YEARS.
    •    The project you wish to complete must be identified in your EFP Action Plan.
    •    The Project Advisor must approve the plan or design of the soil conservation project.
    •    Funds will be allocated on receipt of completed applications. No expenditure will be funded which is
         incurred prior to final written approval.
    •    For further details contact the Project Advisor: Gwen Vessey, PEI Department of Agriculture, at
         (902)368-5650, gtvessey@gov.pe.ca or Tyler Wright at (902)569-7642, tmwright@gov.pe.ca

Eligible Expenses:
    •    diversion terraces, grassed waterway and farmable berm construction
    •    field consolidation work
    •    erosion control matting, silt fencing and energy dissipaters
    •    seedbed preparation, fertilizer, lime and grass seed - $400/.4 hectare (1 acre) if done by applicant
    •    surface inlets and culverts if required for soil conservation projects
    •    silt retention ponds

Funding Assistance:
Funding assistance will be provided at a rate of 66% of eligible expenses to a maximum of $30,000.

Responsibilities of Applicant:
    •    The applicant must verify plan location and requirements with the contractor prior to construction.
    •    The applicant must receive permission from adjoining downstream landowner(s) prior to discharging
         surface or subsurface drainage across property boundaries.
    •    The applicant is responsible for obtaining all required licenses, permits, approvals or authorizations and
         for complying with all applicable municipal, provincial and federal legislation.
    •    The applicant must adhere to the Construction Guidelines for Erosion Control structures to mitigate
         potential environmental risks during construction. These will be provided with project approval.
    •    The applicant must ensure that all works constructed through this program will be maintained and
         properly managed for a minimum 15 year period.
    •    The applicant must repair any damage that might occur to the erosion control structures and provide
         adequate fertility for grasses.
    •    The applicant must perform recommended farm management practices regarding the timing of and
         applications rates of manure, commercial fertilizers and pesticides to avoid surface and groundwater
         contamination.

Control Structure Requirements:
    •    All construction work must be completed between May 01 and August 31.
    •    Erosion control structures are to be seeded immediately after construction with a recommended
         grass/cereal mix and then immediately stabilized with erosion control matting as prescribed.
    •    Construction work must be done to an approved standard. A representative of the PEI Department of
         Agriculture, will provide technical support with project design, lay the project out in the field, provide
         guidance to the contractor and inspect the completed project.
