14(3)If a well is located adjacent to a building, it shall be located so that
the centre line, extended vertically, of the well is not closer than two metres
from the building or any portion of the building.
CONSTRUCTION OF A WELL

15No person shall construct a well in a manner or location such that surface
water may enter the well.

16(1)No well shall be drilled unless the well driller installs casing in
standard pipe size and weight in accordance with Schedule A, which casing shall

(c)be properly welded or connected where required to prevent contamination of
water in the well,
(d)have an inside diameter that is at least 12.7 centimetres unless exempted by
the Minister, and
(e)have welded or threaded on the end in contact with the soil or rock an
appropriate sized drive shoe suitable for providing a seal with the adjacent
formation.
16(2)If compliance with subsectionÂ (1) does not prevent contamination of the
water in the well, the well contractor shall
(a)firmly seat the casing in bedrock at a depth specified by the Minister,
(b)surround the casing with a cement grout that is not less than sixty
millimetres in thickness, and
(c)carry out such remedial action as the Minister may determine.

16(4)Where the drilling and disinfection of a well has been completed, a well
driller shall seal the upper open end of the casing with a well seal of a type
approved by the Minister in such a manner as to prevent contamination of the
well before a pump is installed.

17No connection below the land surface shall be made to the casing of a drilled
well unless the connection is made watertight by means of a well seal
commercially manufactured for that purpose.
DUG WELLS

18(1)A dug well shall have a casing that extends at least one hundred and fifty
millimetres above the immediate land surface and shall be protected against
surface waters entering the well by means of a sloping impermeable apron or
housing or other adequate protection approved by the Minister before
construction of the well.
18(2)From the top of a dug well to a distance at least two metres below the
immediate land surface, the casing of a dug well, at the opening of the well,
shall be constructed of concrete rings, steel rings, poured reinforced
concrete, brick or some other material approved by the Minister before
construction of the well and the joints thereof shall be watertight.

19(1)From the top of a dug well to a distance at least two metres below the
immediate land surface, the annular space between the casing or rocked-up
portion of the well and the surrounding side walls of the excavation shall be
filled with clean washed gravel, sand, crushed rock or small boulders.
19(2)Any portion of the annular space between the casing or rocked-up portion
of a dug well and the surrounding side walls of the excavation not filled with
the materials referred to in subsectionÂ (1) shall be filled with cement grout,

well shall be filled with clay or clean earth for a distance of at least five
metres in all directions from the opening and graded at the opening to an
elevation at least six hundred millimetres above the ground.

26The owner of a drilled well which does not have a pump installed, who does
not intend to use the well within six months, shall cap the well with a device
which is commercially manufactured for the purpose and which is sufficient to
prevent the entry into the well of any substance which might impair the quality
of the water in the well.

27Where a well is not in use and its continued existence might constitute a
safety hazard or allow a contaminant to enter the aquifer, the owner of the
well shall fill and seal the well using a method approved by the Minister
sufficient to prevent the vertical movement of water in the well.

28Where a building is erected so that the centre line, extended vertically, of
a well located adjacent to the building is within two metres of the building,
or any portion of the building, the well shall be filled and sealed in
accordance with sectionÂ 27.

29No well shall be used for waste disposal without the written approval of the
Minister and any such use shall be in accordance with any requirement
established by the Minister in the approval.
PUMP INSTALLATION

30If a pump is installed in a well, the person who installs the pump shall
(a)except in the case of a dug well, seal the top of the well casing with a
well cap commercially manufactured for the purpose,
(b)disinfect the pump and the well using a method of disinfection approved by
the Minister before installation of the pump, and
(c)install an air vent that has an inside diameter of not less than six
millimetres and that extends into the open air at least three hundred
millimetres above the land surface at the opening of the well and the open end
of which is shielded and screened to prevent the entry into the air vent of any
substance which might impair the quality of the water in the well.

with a control device of a type approved by the Minister that prevents or
minimizes the flow of water to waste.
EVALUATION OF WELL YIELD

32(1)No well driller shall complete the construction of a well without
performing an adequate test to determine the rate of yield of the well, which
shall be carried out in accordance with the water well construction and testing
procedures determined by the Minister.
32(2)If a well is intended to supply water as part of a public water supply,
testing of the well shall be carried out in accordance with the requirements of
the Minister, which may include construction of observation wells for proper
measurement of the well and aquifer properties.
32(3)The minimum requirements for the testing of public water supply wells
include a development period, a stage drawdown test and a constant rate test,
all including water level measurements in the well and in at least one
observation well, which measurements shall be continued after pumping has
stopped until such time as the recovery curve can be identified.
32(4)If a well is intended to supply water for any purpose other than that
described in subsectionÂ (2) to meet a demand in excess of fifty cubic metres
per day, a pumping test of not less than twenty-four hours duration shall be
conducted.
32(5)If a well is intended solely to supply water for household purposes to not
more than one single family dwelling unit or to produce not more than fifty
cubic metres of water per day, a yield test of not less than one hour duration
shall be carried out in accordance with the water well construction and testing
procedures determined by the Minister.
32(6)Water level measurements shall be made before, during and after the
pumping test and sufficient measurements of water levels shall be made
immediately after pumping stops to establish the recovery curve.
REPORTS

33The results of any tests or measurements made under sectionÂ 32 shall be
reported to the Minister within thirty days after the completion of the
testing.

34(1)A person who bores, drills, digs or redrills a well or causes a well to be
