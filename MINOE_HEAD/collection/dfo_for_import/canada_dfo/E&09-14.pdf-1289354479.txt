           SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM MAINTENANCE

Proper routine maintenance is a key to long term satisfactory operation of an on-site sewage
disposal system. This is the responsibility of the owner.
In order to get the optimum performance out of a septic system, the following should be
noted:
      (a) When the system is being installed, reference the location of the septic tank and
      the disposal field to some permanent markers.
      (b) Do not overload the hydraulic design of the system. Keep water consumption to a
      minimum and repair leaky faucets or toilet tanks.
      (c) Do not allow large quantities of fats, plastics and chemicals to enter the system.
      (d) Have the septic tank pumped when required. The required frequency depends on
      the habits of the household and on the septic tank capacity. However, pumping every
      3 to 5 years is suggested.
      (e) Remove any large trees from the immediate area of the disposal field to prevent
      roots from clogging the pipes.
      (f) Maintain a sod cover over the disposal field to prevent erosion and increase water
      dissipation through evapotranspiration.
      (g) Do not allow vehicles to drive over the disposal field.
      (h) Divert roof drains and surface drainage away from the area of the disposal field.

     Soil loading rate (SLR) is the disposal area required for each one thousand litres per day of
     wastewater generated and is expressed as square metres per 1000 litres per day (m2/1000
     litres/day).
     Contact area (CA) is the minimum square metres per linear metre of gravel / soil interface
     on the bottom of the trenches in the disposal field. The contact area is expressed as square

                                       Design Example - Metric

     Design a sewage disposal system for a 5-unit motel. Each unit contains one bedroom and a
     kitchen. Calculate the length of drainage pipe required for the sewage disposal system for
     (i) a multiple trench disposal field, (ii) a 0.9 metre contour trench disposal field, and (iii) a
     leaching chamber disposal field. The motel is located on a ‘Category I’ lot
     .
     (1) From Appendix B, flow (Q) = 450 litres/unit/day
     Therefore, Q = 5 units x 450 litres/unit/day = 2250 litres/day
     (2) From clause 9(8)(b) of these regulations, the septic tank capacity = 1.5 x 2250 litres/day
