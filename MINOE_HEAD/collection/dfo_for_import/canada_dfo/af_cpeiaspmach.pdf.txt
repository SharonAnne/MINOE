              IMPROVED STREAM CROSSINGS FOR FARM MACHINERY
                                BMP # 1006
Farm machinery traveling through riparian areas and watercourses will create environmental
problems such as stream bank erosion, water quality issues, and degraded fish and wildlife
habitat. Existing poorly designed stream crossings can washout during runoff events or may not
allow proper fish passage.

Eligibility Criteria:
    • An Environmental Farm Plan (EFP) must have been completed/updated WITHIN THE
        PAST FIVE YEARS.
    • The project you wish to complete must be identified in your EFP Action Plan.
    • Funds will be allocated on receipt of completed applications. No expenditure will be
        funded which is incurred prior to final written project approval.
    • The Project Advisor must complete a site visit prior to project initiation to review options
        and discuss project detail and permit requirements with applicant. For further
        information, please contact Tyler Wright, PEI Department of Agriculture, 902-569-
        7642 (Office), 902-314-0789 (Cellular), or email tmwright@gov.pe.ca.

Eligible Expenses:
    • engineering design costs
    • removal of existing faulty crossing
    • repair to existing crossings
    • construction of new crossings including all material, labour and excavation costs
       associated with the installation of a culvert or bridge type structure
    • seeding and site stabilization costs

Funding Levels:
Assistance for expenditures will be provided at the rate of 50% of eligible costs to a maximum of
$20,000 within the Riparian Area Management and Shelterbelt Establishment category.

Responsibilities of Applicant:
   • The applicant must adhere to the Construction Guidelines for Improved Stream
     Crossings. These Construction Guidelines are available by contacting the Project
     Advisor and they will be provided with the project approval letter.
   • The applicant is responsible for obtaining any required licenses, permits, approvals or
     authorizations and for complying with all applicable municipal, provincial and federal
     legislation.
   • The applicant must ensure that all works constructed under this program will be
     maintained and properly managed for a minimum 15 year period.

Specific Requirements:
   • Projects are only eligible if they fund improvements to, or the replacement of, existing faulty
       crossings.
    •   Stream crossings are only eligible for funding if there is an on-going agriculture activity across
        the stream. New stream crossings associated with a new or expanded agriculture activity are not
        eligible.
    •   A replacement stream crossing can be relocated if the existing location is deemed unsuitable from
        an environmental or fisheries perspective.
    •   A Stream Alteration Permit will be required for all stream crossings. The applicant is responsible
        to receive approval from the PEI Department of Environment, Energy and Forestry, prior to
        proceeding with any work.
    •   The applicant must consult with the Navigable Waters Division of Transport Canada to determine
        if the stream is navigable prior to proceeding with any work. If the stream is considered
        navigable, a formal application must be made under the Navigable Waters Protection Act and no
        work can proceed until approval is granted.
    •   The site must be stabilized with proper seeding immediately after construction and recommended
        erosion control mitigation measures must be followed throughout the construction period.
